# GeodesicTest

All feature requirements met, including some extras like:
- [x] flagging
- [x] the option to force grid aspect ratio
- [x] restarting the game if you hit a bomb

## NOTE
There are some optimzations in this project that require the '/std:c++latest' compiler option.
The project will work fine without it, just note that not all optimizations will be enabled.
